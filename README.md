# PINO for long-term stats in chaotic dynamics

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper **Beyond Closure Models: Learning Chaotic-Systems via Physics-Informed Neural Operators**. The paper is available at [arxiv.org/abs/2408.05177](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05177).

## Introduction

Our paper contains experiments on three chaotic dynamics, 1D Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, 2D Kolmogorov Flow (Navier-Stokes) with small (100) and challenging ($1.6\times 10^4$) Reynolds number.

For each dynamics (experiment), the codes consist of the following parts.
1. Numerical Solver (for data generation).
1. Training PINO Model (three steps as described in the paper).
2. Evaluation (estimating long-term statistics and visulize the results)
3. Baseline methods.

```

### Data generation
```
cd ks/solver
python KS_solver.py
```
Control domain size, viscosity coefficient,  the spatio and temporal grid size, the number of trajectories, and the time interval of saving snapshots in `ks/solver/ParaCtrl.py`

After generating the data, move the dataset file to `ks/data` and replace the links in Line 15,19,28,30 in  `ks/data_dict.py` with the filename of the dataset.

### Training
Before training, set wandb project name and username in configuration files (../config/ks_*.yaml)
```
wandb:
    project: # add project name here
    entity:  # add your username here
```

and create a file in `config/` named  `wandb_api_key.txt` , which contain your wandb key.

Train the PINO model with
```
cd ks/
python 
ks_train_pino.py   # Supervised-learning with CGS data.
ks_train_pino_2.py  # Supervised-learning with CGS and some FRS data.
ks_train_pino_3.py  # Training with PDE loss.
```

### Evaluation
Before testing the model, one need to have `ks/data/ks_stat_uv_emp_range.pt` (used for computing total variation error), `ks/data/ks_128_1500_random_init.pt` (used as random initialization for evaluation experiments) ready. If they were not there, the former one is generated by running `python range_of_emp_measure.py`, and the second one is generated by saving $t=0$ snapshots from the solver code.

To apply the trained neural operator in coarse-grid simulations, run
```
cd ks/evaluation
python station.py
```

To visualize the results, run `python final_compare_stat.py`. Codes related to visulization and computing error are two functions, `plot_all_stat` and `save_all_err` in `evaluation/plot_stat_new.py`. Before running these visulization codes, one should make shure that the results of all methods have been saved in `data/stat_save` with file names same as in `ks/evaluation/final_compare_stat.py` Line 12-15.

### Baseline Methods
See detailes in `baseline/`.

```

### Data generation
```
cd kf/solver
python gen_data2.py
```
Control domain size, viscosity coefficient,  the spatio and temporal grid size, the number of trajectories, and the time interval of saving snapshots in Line 15-24 of  `kf/solver/gen_data2.py`

After generating the data, move the dataset file to `kf/data` and rename it as *filename_cgs.pt* or *filename_frs.pt*, which should match the link name in `kf/data_dict.py`.



### Training
Before training, set wandb project name and username in configuration files (../config/ks_*.yaml)
```
wandb:
    project: # add project name here
    entity:  # add your username here
```

and create a file in `config/` named  `wandb_api_key.txt` , which contain your wandb key.

```
cd ks/
python 
kf_train1.py   # Supervised-learning with CGS data.
kf_train2.py  # Supervised-learning with CGS and some FRS data.
kf_train3.py  # Training with PDE loss.
```

### Evaluation
Before testing the model, one need to have `kf/data/kf_stat_uv_emp_range.pt` (used for computing total variation error), and the random coarse-grid data set (used as initialization for evaluation experiments) ready. If they were not there, the former one is generated by running `python range_of_emp_measure_kf.py`, and the second one is generated by saving $t=0$ snapshots from the solver code.

To apply the trained neural operator in coarse-grid simulations, run
```
cd kf/evaluation
python station.py
```

To visualize the results, run `python final_compare_stat.py`. Codes related to visulization and computing error are two functions, `plot_all_stat` and `save_all_err` in `evaluation/plot_stat_new.py`. Before running these visulization codes, one should make shure that the results of all methods have been saved in `data/stat_save` with file names same as in `kf/evaluation/final_compare_stat.py` Line 11-16.

The input dataset with file name `filename_pde_input.pt` (as in `ns1w/data_dict.py`) are high resolution random functions. They are used only as model input to compute PDE loss in the third stage of the training.



### Training

```
wandb:
    project: # add project name here
    entity:  # add your username here
```
